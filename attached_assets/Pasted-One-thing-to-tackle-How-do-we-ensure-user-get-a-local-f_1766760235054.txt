One thing to tackle.  How do we ensure user get a local feed? should we build a local stream or is there a difffernt way to handle that

Weighed location-based defaults against dedicated local stream approach.

Great question! This is critical for user experience. Here's my recommendation:

Don't Build a Separate Local Stream - Use Location-Aware Defaults Everywhere
Why? Recreational sports are inherently local. Instead of a dedicated "local feed," make the entire platform location-aware by default.

Recommended Approach: Smart Location Context
1. User Location Setup
On Signup/First Visit:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Where do you play?              │
│                                 │
│ [Phoenix, AZ ▼]                 │
│ └─ Detected from IP             │
│                                 │
│ Search radius: [25 miles ▼]    │
│                                 │
│ ✓ Remember this location        │

  primaryLocation: {
    city: "Phoenix",
    state: "AZ",
    lat: 33.4484,
    lng: -112.0740,
    radius: 25 // miles

Key Benefits of This Approach
✅ No duplicate feeds - Everything is location-aware by default ✅ Flexible - Easy to search globally when needed ✅ Transparent - User always knows what location they're viewing ✅ Persistent - Location context follows user across pages ✅ Multi-location - Supports people with multiple play areas ✅ Simple UX - One location selector, not separate "local" vs "global" tabs

Edge Cases Handled
User hasn't set location:

Use IP-based detection
Prompt to confirm/adjust
Show "Showing results near [Detected City]"
User denies location access:

Ask for zip code or city
Default to largest metro area if none provided
Allow manual search
No results in area:

"No golf leagues found in Phoenix (25 miles)"
"Try expanding to 50 miles" [button]
"Or search in another city" [button]
User searches specific city:

Override default temporarily
Show "Showing results in [Searched City]"
Offer to save this location
Bottom Line
Don't build a separate local feed. Instead:

Make location the default filter on EVERY page
Always show location context (header bar)
Make it stupid-easy to change location
Support multiple saved locations
Default radius to ~25 miles for most users
This keeps the architecture simple while ensuring users never see irrelevant distant content. The platform feels local without needing separate feeds.
