# The-League Backend

## Overview
FastAPI backend for a two-sided marketplace platform connecting athletes with recreational sports leagues. Venues (golf courses, bowling alleys, sports complexes, esports arenas) create and manage leagues for various sports.

## Architecture

### Venue-Centric Model
- **Venue**: Physical/virtual location that hosts leagues (golf_course, bowling_alley, sports_complex, esports_arena, etc.)
- **Sport**: Defines sport types with scoring systems (supports Golf, Pickleball, Softball, Bowling, Chess, etc.)
- **VenueSport**: Links venues to sports they support
- **League**: Competition organized by a venue for a specific sport
- **Season**: Time-bounded period within a league with registration deadlines
- **Registration**: Player enrollment in a season with approval workflow

### Role-Based Access Control
- **VenueMember**: User membership in a venue with role (owner, admin, staff)
- **LeagueRole**: User role within a specific league (organizer, captain, participant)
- Owner/Admin can create leagues, Staff can manage teams/games/scores
